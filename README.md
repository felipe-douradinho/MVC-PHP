# MT4 Framework

## Installation

Once you clone the branch **master** to the hosting system and create a **database**, you will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:

- PHP >= 5.6.4
- PDO PHP Extension
- MySQL >= 5.6

All the following commands must to be executed on a shell terminal. Many hosting providers allows access to their hosting  accounts using ssh.

Copy **.env.example** as **.env**:

    cp -f -R .env.example .env

Now, with an text editor, open and edit the **.env** file and configure your database connection and all the others settings.

## Credits

The system has been developed by the **Felipe Douradinho** to the MT4 team.
